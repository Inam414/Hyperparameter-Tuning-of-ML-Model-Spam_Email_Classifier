# Hyperparameter Tuning of ML Models

This project is an extension of the previous project, "Spam Email Classifier," done as part of my internship at CodexCue. In this project, we focus on improving the performance of our spam email classifier by applying hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - **Grid Search:** Implement grid search to systematically explore the hyperparameter space and find the best combination of hyperparameters.
  - **Random Search:** Use random search as an alternative to grid search for hyperparameter tuning, especially when the hyperparameter space is large.
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluate the performance of the tuned model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Visualize the performance of different models before and after tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the same as the one used in "Spam Email Classifier,"

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`
- Google Colab for execution
