# Hyperparameter-Tuning-of-ML-Model-Spam_Email_Classifier

This project is a part of my internship at CodexCue, where we build a machine learning model to classify spam emails. The dataset consists of emails with various features, and the task is to predict whether an email is spam or not.

## Project Overview

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Preprocessing the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Selection:**
  - Exploring different classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests.
  - Applying hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
- **Model Training:**
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Training the chosen classification models on the training data.
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Visualizing the performance of different models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`
- Google Colab for execution
